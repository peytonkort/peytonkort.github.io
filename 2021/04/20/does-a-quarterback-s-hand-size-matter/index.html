<p>One of the best measurements in the NFL Draft Combine is the hand size measurements. Hand size measurement at the NFL Combine is done by measuring the tip of the thumb to the tip of the pinky finger with the hand outstretched.</p>
<p>As a fan this is one of the most laughable measurements in the draft. Who is going to pick there future star quarterback based off there hand size? So this got me thinking… does hand size really matter? Let’s look at the stats and see.</p>

<p>I got all of my data and stats from Sports-Reference.com for the main passing and rushing statistics. Then to get the hand size data I went through two websites, mockdraftable.com and playerprofiler.com. I would put each quarterbacks hand size in a google sheet then made a .csv of the file to put in here.</p>

<p>First I want to narrow my data set down to quarterbacks that have had a lot of playing time over this season. So I want to filter out with QBs over 1000 passing yards. Also I want to see the mean of hand sizes of all the quarterbacks that played in the NFL last season. I can use this to make comparison’s down the road.</p>

<p>The statistics I want to compare hand size too is fumbles per game, interceptions per game and passing yards per game. I’m using per game data because some of these players didn’t play every game during the season. This should balance out the comparisons for those who didn’t play a full season.</p>
<p>Hand size <em>should</em> play a part in fumbles, because of the ability to grip the football if you have bigger hands. Therefore you should fumble less than players with smaller hands. Also I’m going to compare interceptions, because they are a part of turnovers just like the fumbles. Lastly I chose passing yards per game because I want to see if hand size has any affect on that stat. Passing is also the most important stat of a quarterback in the NFL, obviously. So I have to see if there is a correlation.</p>

<p>The red and blue lines in this scatter plot shows the average for both hand size and fumbles per game of quarterbacks in the NFL. You can see that Joe Burrow (2020 #1 overall pick) had the highest fumble per game average, with his small hands of just 9.0 inches. Players like Tom Brady of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs have below the average hands, and fumbled just below the league average. Dak Prescott of the Dallas Cowboys, who has the biggest hands of the anyone in the data set, had a relatively high fumble per game rate. And Nick Foles of the Chicago Bears who has just over 10.5 inch hands, had a very low fumble per game rate. Looking at this chart it is very evenly mixed of different hand sizes and the fumble per game average.</p>

<p>The red and blue lines again show the average of hand size and interceptions per game. As you can see Dak Prescott and Tom Brady are above the average for interceptions per game, despite Dak having 10.875 inch hands and Tom having 9.375 inch hands. Then you got Joe Burrow and Patrick Mahomes having below average hand size and below average interceptions per game. Then you got Deshaun Watson of the Houston Texans, the NFL’s leading passer in the 2020 season, having a low interception per game rate with above average size hands. Again, very evenly mixed with hand size and interceptions per game.</p>

<p>Again red and blue lines are for the avergae for passing yards per game and hand sizes. For this passing yards per game scatter plot Dak Prescott had the most passing yards per game while having the biggest hands (despite only playing 5 games before getting injured). Guys like Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes were above the league average in passing yards per game while being below average hand size. Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens was below league average by a bit in passing yards per game, while having below averae hand size. Baker Mayfield of the Cleveland Browns has above average size hands, but is below average in passing yards per game. This scatter plot shows most small handed quarterbacks were more likely to pass for over the average. With bigger hands it was the opposite. Very interesting.</p>
<p>Now let’s compare some of the top 19 quarterbacks in the NFL with there hand size and fumbles per game. Fumbles per game is the most talked about stat for hand size. So let’s see if there is an affect among the top QB’s. All these quarterbacks I am comparing started at least 12 games this past season.</p>

<p>Matthew Stafford, at a 10.0 inch hand (above the 9.55 hand size average of NFL QB’s), had the lowest fumble per game average. Then you look at a guy like Phillip Rivers who has a 9.25 inch hand and has the 2nd lowest fumble per game average. He is a relatively an outlier. Derek Carr of the Las Vegas Raiders had the highest fumble per game average at 0.6875 while having the 3rd smallest hands in this list at 9.125 inches.</p>
<p>Let’s compare some of the quarterback’s with small hands and big hands. The four quarterbacks I am going to use to compare are Jared Goff (9.0 inch hand), Ryan Tannehill (9.0 inch hand), Russel Wilson (10.25 inch hand) and Josh Allen (10.125 inch hand). All these quarterbacks started 16 games except for Goff who started 15.</p>

<p>Goff and Wilson each had 7 fumbles on the year despite the hand size difference. Tannehill had 6 fumbles, while bigger hand Josh Allen had 9.</p>
<p>Now let’s see the passing yards per game difference, since it looked like there was a correlation in our scatter plot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wafflechartpass &lt;- c(&quot;Jared Goff&quot;=263.5, &quot;Russel Wilson&quot;=263.3)

<p>As you can see Goff and Wilson were nearly identical at 263.5 for Goff, and 263.3 for Wilson. But for Tannehill and Allen you can see a big difference in the passing yards per game. Allen was at 284.0 passing yards per game during the season while Tannehill was at 238.7.</p>
<p>In conclusion, does a quarterbacks hand size affect there overall game? From my results I would say no. Despite Joe Burrow leading the NFL in fumbles per game while having the smallest hands at 9.0 in my data set, other guys that have an above average hand size also fumble the ball quite a bit and aren’t too far off Burrow. You look at Josh Allen who fumbles so much more than Ryan Tannehill and Jared Goff, despite having over an inch bigger of a hand. I believe that the hand size measurements is just another measurement to get us talking about the NFL Draft and the future quarterbacks of the league. It does not affect the players stats.</p>
