      <description>One of the best measurements in the NFL Draft Combine is the hand size measurements. Hand size measurement at the NFL Combine is done by measuring the tip of the thumb to the tip of the pinky finger with the hand outstretched.
As a fan this is one of the most laughable measurements in the draft. Who is going to pick there future star Quarterback based off there hand size?</description>
