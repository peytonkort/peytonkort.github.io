      <description>One of the best measurements in the NFL Draft Combine is the hand size measurements. Hand size measurement at the NFL Combine is done by measuring the tip of the thumb to the tip of the pinky finger with the hand outstretched.
As a fan this is one of the most laughable measurements in the draft. Who is going to pick there future star Quarterback based off there hand size?</description>

      <description>Teams like VCU and UCLA have had incredible runs in March. Back in 2011, VCU made it all the way to the Final Four as an 11 seed. UCLA has made that exact same run as an 11 seed this year.
But what do these two teams have in common. Both were teams that had to play in the First Four, which are the lowest at-large teams facing off against each other.</description>
